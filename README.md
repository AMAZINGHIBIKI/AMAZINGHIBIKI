  HIHI! Name's Aretino, but most people call me Spin/Spinny! I'm fine with any nicknames as long as they are appropriate!! If you're from Pony Town, I usually stay around phighting area along with a friend of mine, feel free to hmu with messages! ( Though whispers are suggested because I won't see public notifications. ) Only drag me around if ya need something!! ( I have a tini bit of issues with signals, so it's a little hard for me to venture around! ) If I happen not to respond, I'm away from the computer!

  I LIKE ENSTARS and my fav/comfort character is WATARU!!!! HE'S SO COOL!!1 BUT YEAH, my main interest is ensemble stars, but I have other interests too! I'm fairly active on HSR and ZZZ!! Though to warn you, I might not be very knowledgeable about the lore, just the main layout of it. I'm also into DAYS UNION (DU) and created some ocs!! Keep in mind that I don't support the admins. Other fandoms I'm in but not really into by now are DBH, R1999, phighting and GI.
  Still talking about interests, I like studying psychology such as MBTI, enneagrams, and many more. I'm an INXJ ( Not sure between INFJ or INTJ.), 6w5.

  I might be a little dry sometimes, so bear with me!! Oh yeah, some add-ons, I'm an artist who draws OCS mostly but sometimes fanart too!! 
Yeah, I think that's all I can say for now, I'll add more if I have some in my mind!! Overall, nice to meet you! Have a great day!!!!!1
