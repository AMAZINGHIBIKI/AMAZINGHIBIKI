  Hi! Name's Reverie, but most people call me Spin/Spinny because of my discord username, people call me pixel or shovel too, haha. I'm fine with any nicknames as long as they are appropriate!! I use any pronouns, feel free to refer me as any pronouns you like to see me as. If you're from Pony Town, I usually appear anywhere, just kinda in the game if my partner is there. Mostly idling from pt, so whisper if you want to talk, it gives notifications!

  Discussing interests, I like studying psychology such as MBTI, enneagrams, and many more. I'm an INTJ, 6w5.

  Text might be a dry to keep my energy constant, so please don't perceive it as rude. Oh yeah, some add-ons, I'm an artist who draws OCS mostly but sometimes fanart too!
Yeah, I think that's all I can say for now, I'll add more if I have some in mind!! Overall, nice to meet you! Have a great day!!
